The issue presented in this assignment is privacy issues related to email login. Email is one of the most important but also vulnerable services to attacks such as email login hacking. To solve this problem what we have to do is create a code that can tell us if an illegal email login occured in our email accounts. One way we can solve this problem is by assigning user device id related to your email account. The other is by formatting the ids related to the account using dicitions. If the device id is logged in from a device that is not registered in the email the user will get an alert. So for our project we will create an algorithm which detects if the device used to login to the email is illegal.
